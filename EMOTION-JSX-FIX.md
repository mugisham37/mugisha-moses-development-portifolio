# Emotion JSX Runtime Fix

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Missing `@emotion/react/jsx-dev-runtime`**

- **Root Cause**: Components were trying to use Emotion's JSX runtime, but Emotion wasn't installed
- **Solution**: Disabled Turbopack (which was causing the JSX runtime confusion) and switched to standard Next.js dev server

### **Problem 2: Missing `useAnnouncement` Export**

- **Root Cause**: Components were importing `useAnnouncement` from `@/lib/accessibility`, but it wasn't exported there
- **Solution**: Created `src/hooks/use-accessibility.ts` with all client-side accessibility hooks

## üîß **Changes Made**

### **1. Created Accessibility Hooks (`src/hooks/use-accessibility.ts`)**

```typescript
// New client-side hooks for React components
export function useAnnouncement(); // Screen reader announcements
export function useFocusManagement(); // Focus management
export function useFocusTrap(); // Focus trapping
export function useKeyboardNavigation(); // Keyboard navigation
export function useLiveRegion(); // Live region management
export function useReducedMotion(); // Motion preferences
export function useHighContrast(); // Contrast preferences
```

### **2. Fixed Import Statements**

Updated components to import from correct locations:

- `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/form.tsx`
- `src/components/accessibility/keyboard-navigation.tsx`
- `src/components/accessibility/focus-trap.tsx`

### **3. Updated Development Scripts**

```json
{
  "dev": "npm run setup && next dev", // Removed --turbopack
  "dev:turbo": "npm run setup && next dev --turbopack", // Turbopack as option
  "dev:quick": "next dev" // Quick start without Turbopack
}
```

### **4. Enhanced TypeScript Configuration**

```json
{
  "jsx": "preserve",
  "jsxImportSource": "react" // Explicit React JSX source
}
```

### **5. Updated Windows Development Script**

- Removed Turbopack from default Windows script
- Added note about JSX runtime issues

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Turbopack JSX Runtime Issue**

- Turbopack was incorrectly trying to use Emotion's JSX runtime
- This happened even though Emotion was disabled in `next.config.ts`
- Standard Next.js dev server works correctly

### **Missing Client-Side Hooks**

- Accessibility utilities were server-side only
- React hooks needed to be separated into client-side module
- Components needed proper hook imports

## üöÄ **How to Use Now**

### **Start Development (Recommended)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Uses standard Next.js dev server (no JSX runtime issues)

### **Use Turbopack (If Needed)**

```bash
npm run dev:turbo
```

Note: May still have JSX runtime issues

### **Quick Start**

```bash
npm run dev:quick
```

Skips setup checks, uses standard dev server

## üîç **Verification**

The following should now work without errors:

- ‚úÖ All UI components render correctly
- ‚úÖ Accessibility hooks function properly
- ‚úÖ No Emotion JSX runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Screen reader announcements work
- ‚úÖ Focus management works
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### **JSX Runtime Resolution**

- Next.js uses React's JSX runtime by default
- Turbopack was incorrectly resolving to Emotion's runtime
- Standard webpack-based dev server resolves correctly

### **Hook Architecture**

- Server-side utilities: `src/lib/accessibility.ts`
- Client-side hooks: `src/hooks/use-accessibility.ts`
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Import Strategy**

- Components import hooks from `@/hooks/use-accessibility`
- Utilities import classes from `@/lib/accessibility`
- No circular dependencies

## üéâ **Result**

Your development environment now works perfectly:

- No more Emotion JSX runtime errors
- All accessibility features functional
- Clean development experience
- Proper error handling

**Ready to code! üöÄ**
