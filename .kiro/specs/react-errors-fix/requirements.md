# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical React errors occurring in the Next.js development environment, including `React.Children.only` errors from Radix UI Slot components, undefined property access errors in animation components, and browser caching issues that prevent fresh updates from being displayed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React.Children.only error to be resolved so that the application runs without crashing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Button component uses asChild={true} THEN it SHALL only accept a single React element child
2. WHEN multiple children are passed to a Slot component THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without throwing errors
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not display React.Children.only errors in the console

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ViewportAnimation component to handle undefined variants gracefully so that animation errors don't crash the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ViewportAnimation receives an invalid variant THEN it SHALL fallback to a default variant
2. WHEN variants.visible is undefined THEN the system SHALL provide a safe default animation state
3. WHEN animation components render THEN they SHALL not throw "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser caching issues to be resolved so that code changes are immediately visible during development

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the browser SHALL display the updated version without manual cache clearing
2. WHEN the development server restarts THEN the browser SHALL load fresh assets
3. WHEN static assets are updated THEN they SHALL be served with appropriate cache-busting headers in development

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want font loading errors to be resolved so that the application displays fonts correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all custom fonts SHALL load without 500 errors
2. WHEN font files are requested THEN they SHALL be served with correct MIME types and headers
3. WHEN fonts fail to load THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully to system fonts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so that the application remains stable during development

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
2. WHEN component props are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL continue to function with fallback behavior
