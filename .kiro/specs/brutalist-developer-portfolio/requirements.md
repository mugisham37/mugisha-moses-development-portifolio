# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for building an elite Next.js 14 developer portfolio that combines brutalist design aesthetics with cutting-edge full-stack functionality. The portfolio serves as both a showcase of technical mastery and a conversion machine that transforms visitors into clients through exceptional execution and unapologetic excellence.
