# Portfolio Design Transformation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive transformation of the Next.js developer portfolio from its current 3/10 design state to a perfect 10/10 brutalist-inspired, modern, and highly engaging developer portfolio. The transformation will combine the best elements from the existing Next.js project, the HTML design reference, and cutting-edge modern web design trends to create an exceptional portfolio that stands out in the competitive developer landscape.
