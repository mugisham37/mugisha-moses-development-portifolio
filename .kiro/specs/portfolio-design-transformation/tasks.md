## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies

- Tasks 1-2 must be completed before any component work (3-5)
- Navigation (5) should be completed before hero section work (6-12)
- Hero section tasks (6-12) can be worked on in parallel after navigation
- Footer (13) and landing page (14) depend on component system (3-5)
- Visual enhancements (15-16) require component foundation
- Mobile optimization (17) should be tested throughout but finalized after core features
- Performance (18) and accessibility (19) are ongoing but have final optimization phases
- Content integration (20) requires all visual components to be complete
- Testing phases (21-22) are final validation steps

### Quality Standards

- All animations must maintain 60fps performance
- All components must pass WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- All code must include proper TypeScript types and documentation
- All components must be responsive and mobile-optimized
- All implementations must include proper error handling and fallbacks

### Performance Targets

- Lighthouse Performance Score: 90+
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- First Input Delay: < 100ms

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to transforming the portfolio into a world-class, 10/10 design through incremental, manageable coding tasks that build upon each other to create a cohesive, exceptional user experience.
