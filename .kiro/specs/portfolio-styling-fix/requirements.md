# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio project is experiencing comprehensive styling and animation issues where the carefully designed brutalist themes, animations, and visual effects are not being properly applied to components. The project has extensive CSS architecture with theme systems, component styles, and animations, but there are critical disconnects between the styling definitions and their application to components. This results in a visually broken experience that doesn't match the intended brutalist design aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want to see the proper brutalist styling applied to all sections, so that the visual design matches the intended aesthetic and creates the desired impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all sections SHALL display with their intended brutalist styling including borders, shadows, and typography
2. WHEN viewing the hero section THEN it SHALL display with proper background effects, animations, and theme-specific styling
3. WHEN viewing the navigation THEN it SHALL display with proper brutalist borders, shadows, and hover effects
4. WHEN viewing any section THEN the theme-specific CSS variables SHALL be properly applied and accessible to components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want to see smooth animations and transitions throughout the site, so that the interactive experience feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL display the defined hover animations and effects
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN components SHALL smoothly transition between theme styles
3. WHEN scrolling through sections THEN scroll-triggered animations SHALL activate properly
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN animations SHALL be appropriately optimized for performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want the theme system to work correctly, so that I can experience both the extreme and refined brutalist themes as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme is set to extreme brutalist THEN all components SHALL use the extreme theme variables and styling
2. WHEN the theme is set to refined brutalist THEN all components SHALL use the refined theme variables and styling
3. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and all components SHALL update consistently
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the theme SHALL be properly initialized and applied to all components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want all component styles to be properly imported and applied, so that each section displays with its intended visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any component THEN its specific CSS styles SHALL be loaded and applied correctly
2. WHEN CSS files are imported THEN they SHALL be processed and available to components
3. WHEN components reference CSS classes THEN those classes SHALL exist and be properly styled
4. WHEN using CSS custom properties THEN they SHALL be defined and accessible throughout the component tree

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want responsive design to work correctly across all devices, so that the brutalist styling adapts appropriately to different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN all styling SHALL display at full complexity and detail
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN styling SHALL adapt with appropriate simplifications
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN styling SHALL be optimized for performance while maintaining visual impact
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN responsive breakpoints SHALL trigger appropriate style adjustments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the portfolio, I want a clear and systematic approach to styling architecture, so that styles are properly organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new components THEN the styling system SHALL provide clear patterns for implementation
2. WHEN debugging styling issues THEN the CSS architecture SHALL be logical and traceable
3. WHEN updating themes THEN changes SHALL propagate consistently across all components
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the CSS loading strategy SHALL be efficient and minimize render blocking
